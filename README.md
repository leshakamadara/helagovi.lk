   cd ..

   # Frontend

2. Make changes in **client/** or **server/** folders.
3. Test your feature locally.

git add .
git commit -m "Add order management feature"

## Step H: Merge after approval

* Optionally, delete the feature branch after merge.

If you want, I can **also add a small ASCII diagram or flowchart** showing `feature/* â†’ dev â†’ main` so itâ€™s visually clearer for your team.  

Do you want me to add that?
